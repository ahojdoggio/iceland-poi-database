  "name": "Bryggjan Brugghús - Grandi Harbor Brewery & Bistro",
  "description": "Bryggjan Brugghús operates as Reykjavík's premier independent brewery, bistro, and bar at Grandagarður 8 in the revitalized Grandi harbor district, combining on-site craft beer production with full-service restaurant creating comprehensive food-and-drink destination that attracts locals, tourists, and craft beer enthusiasts seeking fresh-from-the-source brewing alongside mouthwatering menu spanning sharing plates, tacos, mussels, and succulent steaks. Since opening in 2015, Bryggjan has established itself as anchor tenant in Grandi's transformation from working industrial harbor to trendy dining and cultural neighborhood, with the brewery's success demonstrating how craft beer production facilities double as social gathering spaces where transparency (visible brewing equipment, fresh beer flowing directly from tanks to taps) creates authentic experience impossible to replicate in conventional bars buying kegs from distant breweries. The bar features 12 draft beer pumps delivering fresh craft beer directly from the brewery, ensuring maximum freshness and quality while showcasing the diverse styles Bryggjan produces—from approachable lagers and pale ales that welcome beer-curious beginners, to assertive IPAs and experimental styles satisfying craft beer geeks who track breweries' latest releases. Operating hours 11:00 AM to 1:00 AM daily provide extensive access across lunch.",
