  "name": "Saga Museum",
  "description": "The Saga Museum is an immersive Viking history museum located at Grandagarður 2 in Reykjavík's Grandi harborfront district, bringing Iceland's medieval sagas to life through over 18 static displays featuring remarkably lifelike silicone wax figures recreating pivotal moments in Icelandic history from the settlement era in the 870s through the Reformation in the 1550s. The museum presents Iceland's story chronologically, beginning with the first Norse settlers who crossed the North Atlantic seeking freedom from Norwegian King Harald Fairhair's consolidation of power. Visitors encounter Ingólfur Arnarson, traditionally recognized as Iceland's first permanent settler who arrived in 874 AD and chose Reykjavík as his homestead, as well as famous explorer Leif Eriksson who sailed west from Greenland around the year 1000 and became the first European to reach North America, predating Columbus by nearly 500 years. The displays depict Snorri Sturluson, the 13th-century chieftain, poet, and scholar who authored the Prose Edda and Heimskringla at his estate in Reykholt before his assassination in 1241. Scenes recreate the conversion to Christianity at the Alþingi parliament in the year 1000, Viking Age battles and blood feuds documented in family sagas, daily life on turf farmsteads, and the violent Reformation period when Iceland was forced to adopt Lutheranism. The exceptionally detailed figures wear authentic reproductions of medieval Icelandic clothing based on archaeological finds.",
