  "name": "Fjöruborðið - Iceland's Most Famous Langoustine Restaurant",
  "description": "Fjöruborðið (At the Seashore) has earned reputation as Iceland's premier langoustine restaurant, operating from a cozy seaside building in the quiet south-coast village of Stokkseyri just 45 minutes from Reykjavík, where the restaurant's single-minded focus on preparing Iceland's sweetest crustaceans in butter and garlic has created devoted following among seafood enthusiasts who make special pilgrimages to experience what many consider Iceland's—and possibly the world's—best langoustine preparations. Located directly behind the ocean berm where Atlantic waves crash onto black sand beach, the restaurant's position creates atmospheric dining where the sound of surf and salt air enhance meals featuring creatures pulled from those same waters. The menu deliberately remains simple, reflecting philosophy that exceptional ingredients require minimal intervention: langoustines are fried in butter and garlic, allowing the sweet, delicate crustacean flavor and tender texture to shine without complex sauces or elaborate presentations obscuring the essential quality that makes Icelandic langoustines (Nephrops norvegicus, marketed as \"Iceland lobster\" though technically large prawns) command premium prices in international markets and Michelin-starred kitchens worldwide.",
