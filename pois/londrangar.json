  "name": "Lóndrangar",
  "description": "Lóndrangar are a pair of dramatic volcanic basalt pinnacles rising directly from the Atlantic Ocean on the southern coast of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula within Snæfellsjökull National Park. These striking sea stacks stand at 75 meters and 61 meters tall respectively, representing the eroded remnants of a once much larger volcanic crater that has been carved away by millennia of relentless ocean waves and coastal erosion. The pinnacles are volcanic plugs—solidified magma that once filled the throat of a crater—composed of hard basalt that proved more resistant to erosion than the softer surrounding rock. The basalt columns formed from rapid cooling of lava, creating the distinctive hexagonal columnar jointing visible in the cliff faces. The rock in the slopes of nearby Svalþúfa hill represents an isolated fragment of the original crater rim, providing geological evidence of the massive erosion that created the current landscape. What was once a continuous stretch of basalt volcanic dykes and lava fields has been sculpted by the Atlantic into these isolated spires standing as sentinels against the ocean. The dramatic cliffs and pinnacles create an ideal habitat for seabirds, and during summer months from May to August, the site transforms into a bustling nesting colony hosting thousands of seabirds including Atlantic puffins, northern fulmars, black-legged kittiwakes, and guillemots. The nearby Þúfubjarg cliff, an imposing bird cliff adjacent to Lóndrangar, hosts particularly large puffin colonies that fill the air with their calls throughout the breeding season.",
