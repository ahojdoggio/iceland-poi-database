  "name": "The Settlement Exhibition (Reykjavík 871±2)",
  "description": "The Settlement Exhibition (Landnámssýningin) presents one of Iceland's most important archaeological discoveries—a Viking Age longhouse from approximately 930-1000 AD preserved in its original location beneath downtown Reykjavík, offering visitors an extraordinary opportunity to stand beside authentic remains of Iceland's earliest permanent settlers. The exhibition's name, \"871±2,\" derives from precise volcanic tephra dating: during excavation in 2001, archaeologists discovered a layer of volcanic ash deposited across Iceland from a Torfajökull eruption dated to 871 AD (with a margin of error of plus or minus two years), beneath which they found wall remnants proving human habitation predated this eruption. This tephra layer serves as an exact time marker in Icelandic archaeology, allowing researchers to date structures and artifacts with unusual precision. The excavated longhouse represents one of the oldest structures found in Reykjavík, built using the traditional Viking Age technique of turf walls supported by timber frames, measuring approximately 20 meters long—substantial enough to house an extended family or small community. The exhibition preserves the longhouse foundation exactly where it was discovered, with carefully controlled environmental conditions preventing deterioration while allowing visitors to view the actual walls, post holes, and living surfaces that Viking Age Icelanders constructed and occupied over a millennium ago.",
