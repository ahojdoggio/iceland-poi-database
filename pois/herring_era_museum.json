  "name": "Herring Era Museum - Iceland's Atlantic Klondike",
  "description": "The Herring Era Museum in Siglufjörður stands as Iceland's largest maritime museum and the nation's only museum to have won the prestigious European Museum Award (in 2000), occupying a remarkably authentic setting in the old Róaldsbrakki salting station that was abandoned after the catastrophic collapse of the herring stock in 1969, preserving the infrastructure, atmosphere, and spirit of an industry that once provided up to 44% of Iceland's export income and transformed Siglufjörður into the \"Atlantic Klondike\"—a boom town where fortunes were made and lost as quickly as the herring came and went. The museum's extraordinary success in preservation and presentation stems from its use of actual working buildings rather than purpose-built exhibition spaces: visitors walk through genuine fish processing facilities, workers' quarters, and storage areas where the herring industry operated at its peak, with machinery, tools, and equipment left largely in place, creating an immersive time-capsule experience that brings history to life with almost overwhelming authenticity. The exhibitions spread across three different historic buildings.",
