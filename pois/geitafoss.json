  "name": "Geitafoss - The Goats' Waterfall",
  "description": "Geitafoss, translating to \"Goats' Falls,\" is a modest but charming 5-meter waterfall on the powerful Skjálfandafljót river in North Iceland, located in close proximity to the much more famous Goðafoss (Waterfall of the Gods) along the Diamond Circle route. The waterfall's unassuming name derives from local farming history—a farmer who drove his sheep and goats through this area gave the falls its name, reflecting the pastoral traditions that have characterized this region for centuries. Despite its relatively small size compared to Iceland's towering cascades, Geitafoss holds biological significance as the upper limit for salmon migration on the Skjálfandafljót river: salmon swim upstream from the ocean through various obstacles and reaches as far as this waterfall, but the 5-meter drop proves too high for even the most determined fish to leap, making Geitafoss the natural boundary that separates the lower river's salmon-bearing waters from the upper river's salmon-free sections. This ecological role makes the waterfall interesting to anglers and fish biologists studying Iceland's Atlantic salmon populations and their spawning behaviors. Geitafoss's location on the same river as Goðafoss means visitors can experience both waterfalls in a single excursion, with Geitafoss offering a quieter, less crowded alternative to its famous downstream neighbor. Access to Geitafoss is possible via footbridge crossing the river.",
