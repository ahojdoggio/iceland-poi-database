  "name": "Systrafoss - The Sisters' Waterfall",
  "description": "Systrafoss, translating to \"Sisters' Falls,\" is a charming double-cascade waterfall that tumbles directly into the heart of Kirkjubæjarklaustur (usually shortened to \"Klaustur\"), a small village of about 120 residents that serves as an important service center for travelers exploring South Iceland's dramatic coastline between Vík and the Vatnajökull glacier region. The waterfall's name derives from the medieval Benedictine convent (klaustur means \"cloister\" in Icelandic) that existed in this location from 1186 until the Protestant Reformation in 1550, when Iceland's Catholic monasteries and convents were disbanded—the nuns who once lived here became known as \"systra\" (sisters), and their memory lives on in the waterfall's name and local folklore. Systrafoss drops from Lake Systravatn, which sits atop the cliffs above Kirkjubæjarklaustur, sending the Fossá river cascading down the mountain edge in two distinct tiers directly into the village below, creating an unusual situation where a significant waterfall effectively serves as the town's backdrop and natural landmark. The waterfall is easily accessible right from Kirkjubæjarklaustur's main road, with parking available at the base, but the real reward comes from taking the moderately steep hiking trail that climbs approximately 50-60 meters elevation gain via a series of steps and switchbacks up the left side of the falls. This trail offers changing perspectives on the waterfall as you ascend, including an excellent viewpoint partway up that provides close views of the upper cascade and impressive photo opportunities.",
