  "name": "Hekla - Gateway to Hell & Iceland's Most Active Volcano",
  "description": "Hekla stands as one of Iceland's most active and notorious volcanoes, rising 1,491 meters (4,892 feet) above surrounding landscape where dominant cone-shaped peak visible for dozens of kilometers across South Iceland's interior has erupted more than 20 times since first documented eruption in 1104 AD, earning fearsome medieval reputation as 'Gateway to Hell' when European monks and scholars believed souls of damned entered underworld through Hekla's fiery crater during spectacular eruptions sending ash, lava, and terror across Icelandic communities. The volcano's terrifying medieval reputation persisted for centuries as 16th-century German geographer Caspar Peucer wrote that 'Gates of Hell could be found in bottomless abyss of Hekla Fell,' while other European writers claimed screams of tortured souls could be heard emanating from crater during eruptions, and birds flying too close would be dragged into inferno—these supernatural beliefs reflected both volcano's explosive violence and limited scientific understanding of volcanic processes before modern geology emerged. The first recorded eruption in 1104 represented massive plinian eruption classified as VEI 5 (Volcanic Explosivity Index), producing enormous ash column, widespread tephra fall that buried farms across southern Iceland, and devastation prompting mass evacuation and agricultural collapse in regions closest to volcano, with this initial historical eruption setting pattern of destructive power that subsequent centuries would repeatedly witness.",
