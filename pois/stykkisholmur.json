  "name": "Stykkishólmur",
  "description": "Stykkishólmur is a charming historic town of approximately 1,100 residents located on the northern coast of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula, serving as the largest settlement and commercial center of the region. Situated on a natural harbor overlooking the island-studded waters of Breiðafjörður bay, the town has served as an important trading post and fishing center since the 16th century. Stykkishólmur gained international recognition as a filming location for The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013), where it stood in for Greenland in Ben Stiller's adventure film. The town's most distinctive landmark is Stykkishólmskirkja Church, designed by architect Jón Haraldsson and inaugurated on May 6, 1990. This modernist architectural marvel features a sweeping concrete bell tower resembling a whale vertebra or ship's prow, rising dramatically above the colorful houses of the old town. The interior showcases hundreds of suspended lights creating a starlit effect and features a striking painting of the Madonna and child floating in the night sky. The Norwegian House (Norska Húsið), built in 1832, holds the distinction of being Iceland's first two-story wood-frame residence, constructed with timber imported from Norway. Today it serves as the regional museum for Snæfellsnes, housing rotating exhibitions on the ground floor and an extensive open storage collection on the upper level, alongside a well-curated museum shop. The building opens daily from 11:00 to 17:00 during summer (June 1 to August 31) and 13:00 to 16:00 in May.",
