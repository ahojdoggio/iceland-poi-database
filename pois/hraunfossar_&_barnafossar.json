  "name": "Hraunfossar & Barnafossar",
  "description": "Hraunfossar and Barnafossar are two spectacular waterfalls located in West Iceland, approximately 120 kilometers from Reykjavík near the historic village of Reykholt. Hraunfossar, meaning \"lava falls,\" is a series of beautiful waterfalls stretching nearly a kilometer, where crystal-clear water flows out from beneath a lava field and cascades down into the glacial river Hvítá. The water originates from Langjökull glacier and seeps through porous lava rock formed thousands of years ago. Just a short walk upstream are the Barnafossar waterfalls, named \"Children's Falls\" after a tragic legend involving two children who fell into the river. Here the river rushes through a narrow gorge with tremendous force, creating powerful rapids and whirlpools. Wooden footbridges and viewing platforms allow visitors to safely admire both waterfalls from multiple angles.",
