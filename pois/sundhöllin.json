  "name": "Sundhöllin - Reykjavík's Historic Central Pool (1937)",
  "description": "Sundhöll Reykjavíkur—commonly known simply as Sundhöllin—holds the distinguished position as Reykjavík's oldest purpose-built indoor swimming facility, opened in 1937 and representing a significant milestone in Iceland's swimming culture and public health initiatives during a period when indoor bathing facilities were rare luxuries. Designed by renowned Icelandic architect Guðjón Samúelsson—whose portfolio includes Hallgrímskirkja church and numerous other iconic Icelandic buildings—the pool exhibits functionalist architecture characteristic of 1930s Nordic design, blending practical purpose with aesthetic consideration. Located at Barónsstígur 45a in central Reykjavík's 101 postal district, Sundhöllin occupies one of the city's most accessible locations within easy walking distance of Laugavegur shopping street, Hallgrímskirkja, and downtown accommodations, making it particularly convenient for tourists staying in central Reykjavík who want to experience authentic Icelandic pool culture without traveling to outlying neighborhoods. The facility underwent comprehensive renovation in 2017 that modernized amenities while preserving its historic character, carefully balancing heritage preservation with contemporary expectations for comfort and hygiene. The renovation added outdoor facilities to complement the original indoor pool, expanding the complex's appeal and utility across seasons. Today's Sundhöllin features both indoor and outdoor swimming pools.",
