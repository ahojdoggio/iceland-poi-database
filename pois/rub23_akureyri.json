  "name": "Rub23 - Akureyri's Sushi & Fusion Seafood Restaurant",
  "description": "Rub23 brings creative fusion cuisine to Akureyri, Iceland's northern capital, offering unique menu concept where diners select their preferred fish or meat and then choose from list of international spice rub mixtures—Asian, American, and traditional Icelandic preparations—that are rubbed into ingredients before cooking, creating personalized flavor combinations that distinguish Rub23 from conventional restaurants offering fixed preparations. The name references this innovative approach: \"rub\" has become common culinary term for mixed spices rubbed into proteins, and the restaurant's philosophy celebrates this technique by offering approximately 23 different variations (hence the number in the name) that allow customers to customize their dining experience. Located at Kaupvangsstræti 6 in central Akureyri, the restaurant operates year-round serving lunch Monday-Friday (11:30 AM-2:00 PM) and dinner daily (5:00-10:00 PM Sunday-Thursday, 5:00-11:00 PM Friday-Saturday), with Saturday being dinner-only. The extensive sushi menu represents significant addition to Akureyri's dining scene, bringing Japanese techniques and preparations to northern Iceland using local fish from Iceland's exceptionally clean fishing grounds—the combination of Japanese precision with Icelandic ingredient quality creates sushi that rivals metropolitan offerings despite Akureyri's population of only 20,000 and remote location 390 kilometers from Reykjavík.",
