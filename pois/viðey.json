  "name": "Viðey - Reykjavík's Art Island with Imagine Peace Tower",
  "description": "Viðey represents Reykjavík's cultural escape located in Kollafjörður just 15 minutes by ferry from city center, where 1.7-square-kilometer island combines Icelandic historical heritage, contemporary art installations, and Yoko Ono's Imagine Peace Tower memorial to John Lennon creating unique destination blending nature, art, and spirituality within easy reach of capital's 130,000+ residents and Iceland's tourist influx. The island's historical significance predates Reykjavík's founding, with Viðey hosting monastery from 1226 until Reformation in 1539, making it one of Iceland's earliest centers of religious, cultural, and economic power where monks cultivated learning, preserved manuscripts, and accumulated wealth through landholdings and tithes that made Viðey monastery among Iceland's richest ecclesiastical institutions. The Viðeyjarstofa (Viðey House) built 1755-1757 as residence for Skúli Magnússon (considered father of Reykjavík for establishing city's industrial enterprises) represents Iceland's oldest stone building still standing, demonstrating rare permanence in country where turf and timber construction dominated until 20th century—this beautifully restored building now houses exhibitions and provides historical anchor connecting contemporary art island to colonial-era Iceland. Yoko Ono's Imagine Peace Tower installed 2007 serves as beacon to world peace dedicated to John Lennon's memory.",
