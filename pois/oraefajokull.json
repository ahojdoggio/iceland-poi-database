  "name": "Öræfajökull",
  "description": "Öræfajökull is Iceland's largest and most powerful active volcano, located in Southeast Iceland as part of the Vatnajökull ice cap. This massive stratovolcano is crowned by Iceland's highest peak, Hvannadalshnjúkur (2,110 m), and has a fearsome eruption history that has profoundly shaped the surrounding region. The volcano last erupted in 1727-1728, producing one of Iceland's most catastrophic volcanic events that destroyed all farms in the area and created the vast sand desert of Öræfi. The volcano remains active with ongoing geothermal activity beneath the ice cap, and scientists closely monitor it for signs of potential future eruptions. The name Öræfajökull translates roughly to 'Wasteland Glacier,' referring to the desolate landscape created by past eruptions.\n\nThe volcano encompasses an approximately 5-kilometer-wide caldera filled with ice, with several outlets glaciers flowing from it including Svínafellsjökull, Kotárjökull, and Skálafellsjökull. These outlet glaciers provide dramatic ice-covered landscapes that attract mountaineers, ice climbers, and tourists. The volcano's structure includes multiple vents and a large ice-filled crater that contains significant geothermal heat. Steam vents and ice caves indicate ongoing volcanic activity beneath the surface. In 2017-2018, increased earthquake activity and ice cauldron formations signaled potential volcanic unrest, prompting enhanced monitoring by Icelandic authorities. The volcano's potential for explosive eruptions combined with rapid ice melt (jökulhlaup) makes it one of Iceland's most hazardous volcanoes.\n\nÖræfajökull is visible from many locations along the southeast coast and Route 1. The best views are from Skaftafell area and surrounding farmlands. Visitors can view outlet glaciers and take guided glacier walks or ice climbing tours on Svínafellsjökull (operated from Skaftafell). Climbing Hvannadalshnjúkur summit requires serious mountaineering skills and should only be attempted with experienced guides. The surrounding area offers numerous hiking opportunities in Vatnajökull National Park. Information about the volcano's history and monitoring is available at the Skaftafell Visitor Center. Due to volcanic hazards, visitors should always check current conditions and heed any warnings or restricted areas established by authorities.",
