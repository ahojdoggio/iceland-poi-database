  "name": "Foss á Síðu - The Blown Away Waterfall",
  "description": "Foss á Síðu is an elegantly slender waterfall that drops dramatically from high cliffs in South Iceland, creating one of the Ring Road's most photogenic roadside attractions despite being easily overlooked by travelers focused on the region's more famous cascades. Located just 10 kilometers east of Kirkjubæjarklaustur village along Route 1, this waterfall sees the narrow Fossá stream—fed from Lake Þórutjörn on the plateau above—plunging vertically down an ancient basalt cliff face that represents what was once Iceland's southern coastline approximately 10,000 years ago, before post-glacial land rebound and sediment deposition pushed the ocean farther south to its current position. The waterfall's height is variously reported as 30 meters, 80 meters, or 82 meters depending on whether measurements include the full cliff face or just the visible freefalling water column, but regardless of precise figures, the visual impact is unmistakable: a thin white ribbon of water dropping through open air down a sheer dark cliff into the green valley below. With a width of only about 3 meters (10 feet), Foss á Síðu represents the opposite of Iceland's massive curtain-like waterfalls—this is delicate verticality, a slender thread connecting the plateau above to the lowlands below. The waterfall has earned the nickname \"The Blown Away Waterfall\" due to a remarkable phenomenon that occurs during Iceland's frequent strong winds: when wind conditions are exactly right.",
