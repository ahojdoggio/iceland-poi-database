  "name": "Grjótagjá",
  "description": "Grjótagjá is a small but visually striking lava cave containing a geothermal hot spring located near Lake Mývatn in North Iceland, situated on private land at the Vogar farm. The cave formed thousands of years ago when molten lava flowing through an underground tube drained away, leaving behind a hollow tunnel that subsequently filled with naturally heated groundwater from geothermal activity in the Krafla volcanic system. The cave features a narrow opening descending into a dimly lit chamber where steaming turquoise water glows ethereally in shafts of light penetrating through cracks in the volcanic rock ceiling. For centuries, Grjótagjá served as a popular natural bathing spot for locals who enjoyed soaking in the warm waters within the atmospheric cave setting, though the water temperature varied considerably depending on geothermal fluctuations. Between 1975 and 1984, intense volcanic activity from nearby Krafla superheated the spring to dangerously scalding temperatures approaching or exceeding boiling point, making bathing impossible and forcing the cave's closure. Although geothermal activity has since decreased and water temperatures have dropped to approximately 43-46°C (109-115°F) in recent years, the spring remains unpredictable, sometimes spiking above 50°C (122°F) due to ongoing geothermal processes. Due to these dangerous temperature fluctuations and the risk of sudden temperature increases, bathing in Grjótagjá has been permanently prohibited. The landowners at Vogar farm constructed a gate at the main entrance and erected signs explicitly forbidding bathing and cave entry to protect visitors from potential scalding injuries. Although the gate may not always be locked, visitors are legally required to respect the prohibition and must not enter the cave or touch the water regardless of gate status. Despite the entry ban, visitors can still view the cave's interior and the luminous geothermal spring from outside the entrance, photographing the beautiful blue-green water and dramatic rock formations through the opening. Grjótagjá achieved international fame when it appeared in Season 3, Episode 5 of HBO's Game of Thrones as the romantic setting where Jon Snow and Ygritte share an intimate moment, cementing the cave's status as a pilgrimage site for fans of the series. However, it's important to note that the bathing scene was filmed before the current prohibition, and the production used controlled water temperatures for actor safety—attempting to recreate this scene would now be both illegal and dangerous. The cave is located just a short distance from Route 1 near the eastern shore of Lake Mývatn, easily accessible via a brief walk from a small parking area. Visitors seeking actual hot spring bathing should instead visit the nearby Mývatn Nature Baths, a professionally managed geothermal spa with regulated water temperatures and full facilities, or explore other legal bathing locations in the area.",
