  "description": "Ytri-Tunga is a unique golden sand beach on the southern coast of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula, distinguished as one of Iceland's most reliable seal-watching locations and a rare example of a non-black sand beach in a country dominated by volcanic black shores. Located approximately 160 kilometers northwest of Reykjavík and 50 kilometers south of Stykkishólmur, the beach lies near a farm of the same name, with parking access just 1 kilometer from Route 54. The golden hue of the sand comes from a distinctive mix of quartz, feldspar, and other minerals shaped by centuries of coastal erosion, creating a striking visual contrast against the typical black volcanic beaches found elsewhere in Iceland. The beach is renowned for its resident seal colony consisting primarily of harbor seals, characterized by their round faces and sleek bodies, which are frequently observed lounging on exposed rocks during low tide. Grey seals, larger than their harbor cousins, occasionally make appearances but are less common visitors. Ytri-Tunga has earned its reputation as perhaps the most reliable seal-watching site in all of Iceland, with seals present year-round, though summer months from May through August offer the best viewing opportunities when seals are most active and numerous. During peak season from June to July, dozens of seals can often be spotted basking on the rocks closest to shore, particularly during low tide when the rocky outcrops are fully exposed above the waterline.",
