  "name": "Ölverk Pizza & Brewery - Geothermal-Powered Craft Brewing",
  "description": "Ölverk Pizza & Brewery operates from Hveragerði, the geothermal village 35 minutes from Reykjavík where steaming vents, hot springs, and geothermal energy infrastructure create landscape defined by volcanic activity, positioning the brewery to harness renewable energy for brewing operations while occupying prime Golden Circle location that guarantees steady tourist traffic exploring Iceland's most famous route. Founded in spring 2017 by owners Laufey and Elvar, Ölverk represents passionate entrepreneurial venture combining two loves—premium wood-fired pizza and fine Icelandic craft beer—into integrated food-and-drink destination where complementary products enhance each other rather than competing for attention. The unique use of geothermal energy in brewing process makes Ölverk must-stop for craft beer enthusiasts and eco-conscious visitors interested in sustainable production methods: geothermal steam and hot water directly heat brewing kettles and facilitate temperature-controlled fermentation, eliminating fossil fuel dependence that burdens conventional breweries while demonstrating how Iceland's volcanic geology provides practical advantages beyond dramatic landscapes.",
