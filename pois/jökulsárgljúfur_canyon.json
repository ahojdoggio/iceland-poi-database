  "name": "Jökulsárgljúfur Canyon - Iceland's Grand Canyon of the North",
  "description": "Jökulsárgljúfur forms Iceland's most impressive canyon system, stretching 25 kilometers through North Iceland's volcanic landscape with depths reaching 120 meters carved by Jökulsá á Fjöllum (Iceland's second-longest river) through series of catastrophic glacial outburst floods (jökulhlaups) most recently occurring approximately 2,000 years ago when massive water volumes burst from beneath Vatnajökull glacier carrying ice, rock, and debris that scoured canyon into bedrock creating geological scar visible from space. The canyon was designated protected national park in 1973 recognizing extraordinary geological, ecological, and aesthetic values, then incorporated into expanded Vatnajökull National Park in 2008 creating Europe's largest national park while maintaining Jökulsárgljúfur's identity as distinct northern section featuring dramatic waterfalls, towering cliffs, unique rock formations, and diverse ecosystems supporting Iceland's richest biodiversity. The waterfall complex within canyon includes Selfoss (11-meter horseshoe waterfall spreading across multiple tiers upstream), Dettifoss (Europe's most powerful waterfall dropping 44 meters with 193 cubic meters per second flow), Hafragilsfoss (27-meter drop approximately 1 kilometer downstream in narrow gorge 90 meters wide), and Réttarfoss, collectively representing world-class concentration of massive waterfalls along single river system that few locations rival for sheer hydraulic power and geological drama.",
