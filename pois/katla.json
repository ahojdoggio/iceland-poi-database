  "name": "Katla - Iceland's Sleeping Giant Under Mýrdalsjökull",
  "description": "Katla represents one of Iceland's most powerful and potentially catastrophic volcanoes, hidden beneath Mýrdalsjökull glacier (Iceland's 4th largest ice cap) where 10-kilometer-wide caldera filled with 500-700 meters of ice conceals subglacial basaltic-to-rhyolitic volcanic system capable of producing devastating jökulhlaups (glacial outburst floods) when eruptions melt enormous ice volumes creating catastrophic water surges carrying icebergs, volcanic debris, and sediment across South Iceland's coastal plains destroying everything in flood path. The volcano has erupted approximately 20 times since Iceland's settlement in 874 AD with notable historical eruptions in 1625, 1660, 1721, 1755 (largest in historical times producing massive tephra fall and jökulhlaup), 1823, and most recently 1918 when 24-day eruption melted glacier ice creating jökulhlaup with peak discharge estimated at 300,000 cubic meters per second—discharge rate exceeding combined flow of Amazon River at its mouth, temporarily extending Iceland's coastline several kilometers southward as flood deposited enormous sediment volumes creating new land. The eruption frequency averaging one eruption every 40-80 years combined with 1918 last eruption means Katla has now exceeded typical repose period by over 100 years.",
