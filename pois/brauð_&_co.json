  "name": "Brauð & Co - Famous Cinnamon Roll Bakery",
  "description": "Brauð & Co has achieved cult status in Reykjavík's competitive bakery scene through obsessive focus on one product done extraordinarily well: cinnamon rolls (kanilsnúður in Icelandic) so beloved that they sometimes sell out before noon despite the bakery baking continuously throughout operating hours, creating situations where disappointed late-comers find themselves planning return visits specifically timed to guarantee cinnamon roll acquisition. Located at Frakkastígur 16 just minutes from Hallgrímskirkja church in downtown Reykjavík, with additional locations inside Hlemmur Mathöll food hall and at Skeifan, the bakery has expanded from single shop to mini-chain while maintaining quality standards that distinguish exceptional baking from industrial production. The Frakkastígur flagship operates daily with early morning opening (6:00 or 7:00 AM depending on day) to serve Icelanders who expect fresh bread available from first light, extending until 5:00 or 6:00 PM when stock depletes and bakers complete their shifts—the variable closing reflects artisan bakery philosophy of baking finite quantities of fresh product rather than maintaining endless supply of progressively staler goods. Operating primarily as grab-and-go establishment with minimal or no seating, Brauð & Co focuses entirely on baked goods quality rather than café atmosphere or full-service dining experience—customers enter, select pastries from the case or counter, pay, and leave with warm paper bags containing still-steaming cinnamon rolls whose aroma attracts passersby from down the block.",
