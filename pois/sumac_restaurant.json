  "name": "Sumac Grill + Drinks - Middle Eastern Flavors in Reykjavík",
  "description": "Sumac brings the nostalgic atmosphere and flavors of Beirut to downtown Reykjavík, offering locals and visitors delicious Middle Eastern cuisine and handcrafted Mediterranean cocktails in a setting that celebrates Lebanese and Moroccan culinary traditions while incorporating exceptional Icelandic ingredients that create unexpected but harmonious flavor combinations. Located at Laugavegur 28 on Reykjavík's main shopping street, the restaurant occupies prime real estate in the city's most trafficked pedestrian area, drawing foot traffic from tourists shopping for Icelandic woolens and locals meeting friends for drinks and dinner. Named after sumac—the tart, lemony spice fundamental to Middle Eastern cooking made from dried and ground red berries of the sumac bush—the restaurant signals its commitment to authentic flavors and traditional spice blends that define Levantine cuisine, though chef Thrainn Freyr Vigfusson creatively integrates Icelandic lamb, seafood, and dairy into Middle Eastern preparations that respect both culinary traditions. The menu showcases Middle Eastern and North African spices and flavors mixed with Icelandic ingredients, creating fusion that never feels forced or gimmicky but instead represents thoughtful exploration of how Iceland's exceptional proteins and vegetables work within established flavor profiles from Moroccan tagines, Lebanese mezze, and pan-Mediterranean grilling traditions. Highlighted dishes include flatbread with za'atar and hummus providing the warm, herbaceous, nutty flavors essential to Middle Eastern dining; grilled oyster mushrooms demonstrating that vegetarian Middle Eastern cuisine offers depth and satisfaction equal to meat-centered dishes; carrots with whipped feta, honey, and cumin combining sweet root vegetables with tangy cheese and warm spice in a preparation that elevates humble ingredients; grilled shrimp skewer with chili and preserved lemon showcasing how Icelandic seafood takes beautifully to Moroccan-Lebanese flavor combinations; and beef short rib with onion, fennel, and hazelnut dukkah offering rich, slow-cooked meat finished with Egyptian spice and nut blend that adds textural complexity and aromatic intensity. Operating Tuesday through Saturday with kitchen hours 17:30-22:00 (Friday-Saturday until 22:30) and bar service extending slightly later (Tuesday-Thursday until 23:00, Friday-Saturday until 23:30), the restaurant focuses on dinner service when Middle Eastern mezze culture of lingering over many small plates with drinks matches Reykjavík's late northern light during summer and cozy indoor gathering during dark winter months. Closed Mondays, giving the kitchen and staff necessary rest that allows consistent quality throughout the busy week. Prices range 16,000-18,000 ISK per person (approximately $115-130 USD), positioning Sumac as special-occasion dining rather than casual meals—the cost reflects both ingredient quality and the labor-intensive preparation required for authentic Middle Eastern cuisine with its multiple components, spice blends, preserved ingredients, and layered flavors that distinguish it from simpler Nordic preparations. Recognition in the 2025 Michelin Guide Iceland validates the restaurant's commitment to excellence and innovative fusion of Mediterranean-Middle Eastern flavors with Icelandic ingredients. The handcrafted cocktail program creates Mediterranean-inspired drinks using regional spirits, fresh herbs, citrus, and spices that complement the food's flavor profiles, with mixologists applying Middle Eastern ingredients like pomegranate, rose water, cardamom, and date syrup to craft beverages that feel cohesive with the culinary experience. Reservations are essential as the restaurant's popularity, limited seating, and prime Laugavegur location create consistent demand.",
