  "name": "Dill Restaurant - Iceland's Only Michelin-Starred Restaurant",
  "description": "Dill holds the singular distinction of being Iceland's first and only Michelin-starred restaurant, earning its One Star rating in 2017 and maintaining this prestigious recognition through consistent excellence in New Nordic cuisine that showcases Iceland's unique ingredients, traditional preservation methods, and culinary heritage through modern techniques and artistic presentation. Founded in 2009 by chef-owner Gunnar Karl Gíslason along with sommelier Ólafur Ágústsson, Dill pioneered the New Nordic movement in Iceland—a culinary philosophy emphasizing local, seasonal, and foraged ingredients prepared with creativity and respect for Nordic food traditions including fermentation, smoking, pickling, and preservation techniques that sustained Icelanders through centuries of isolation and harsh climate. The restaurant's name references dill (Anethum graveolens), the herb that has flavored Icelandic cuisine for generations, symbolizing the connection between traditional and contemporary cooking. Located on Laugavegur 59 in downtown Reykjavík's main shopping street, Dill occupies an intimate space seating approximately 35 guests in a minimalist Scandinavian interior where clean lines, natural materials, and understated elegance create an atmosphere focused entirely on the food, wine, and dining experience rather than showy décor. The tasting menu unfolds over more than 15 carefully curated courses.",
