  "name": "Höfn",
  "description": "Höfn, meaning \"harbour\" in Icelandic, is a picturesque fishing town of approximately 2,200 residents located on a dramatic peninsula in southeastern Iceland, where the Atlantic Ocean meets the majestic Vatnajökull Glacier, Europe's largest ice cap by volume. As the second-largest town in Iceland's southeast and the largest settlement in the Hornafjörður municipality, Höfn serves as the main service center for the region and the gateway to Vatnajökull National Park, Europe's largest national park. Situated approximately 455 kilometers from Reykjavík along Ring Road (Route 1), the town offers unparalleled panoramic views of Vatnajökull's massive ice cap looming on the northern horizon, with multiple glacier tongues visible from the town on clear days. Höfn has earned recognition as the \"Lobster Capital of Iceland,\" renowned throughout the country for its exceptional langoustine (Norway lobster) harvesting and processing industry. Fishing remains the economic backbone of the community, with fresh seafood—particularly the prized langoustine—forming the cornerstone of local culinary culture. Each summer, Höfn transforms into a vibrant celebration center during Humarhátíð, the famous Lobster Festival, where thousands of visitors flock to enjoy fresh seafood, live music, and cultural activities celebrating the town's fishing heritage. The festival has become one of Iceland's premier food events, drawing gourmands from across the country and internationally.",
