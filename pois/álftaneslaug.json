  "name": "Álftaneslaug - Garðabær's Indoor-Outdoor Pool with Wave Pool",
  "description": "Álftaneslaug distinguishes itself as Garðabær municipality's second swimming facility by offering both indoor and outdoor pools alongside Iceland's only wave pool—a unique feature that makes it particularly attractive to families with children while maintaining the hot tubs, saunas, and traditional bathing culture expected at Icelandic swimming facilities. Located in Álftanes, the peninsula portion of Garðabær municipality extending into Faxaflói Bay southwest of central Reykjavík, the pool serves residential neighborhoods known for waterfront properties, proximity to presidential residence Bessastaðir, and spectacular ocean views. Álftaneslaug's dual indoor-outdoor design provides flexibility that appeals to different preferences and weather conditions: some swimmers prefer traditional Icelandic outdoor swimming year-round regardless of wind or cold, enjoying the atmospheric experience of warm water surrounded by cold air; others appreciate indoor sheltered swimming, particularly families with young children, those sensitive to cold, or visitors during Iceland's notorious weather extremes. The 25-meter outdoor pool accommodates lap swimming, recreational use, and the atmospheric outdoor swimming experience that defines Icelandic pool culture—swimming in geothermally heated water while snow falls, northern lights dance overhead, or midnight sun blazes creates memorable experiences impossible in conventional indoor facilities.",
