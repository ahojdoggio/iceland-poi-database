  "name": "Grettislaug pool",
  "description": "Grettislaug is a natural geothermal hot pool located on the shore at Reykir in Skagafjörður, North Iceland, approximately 15 kilometers north of Sauðárkrókur. The pool is steeped in Icelandic saga history - according to the legendary Saga of Grettir the Strong, the famous outlaw Grettir Ásmundarson warmed himself in this very pool after making an incredible 7-kilometer swim from the island of Drangey in freezing waters around the year 1031. Today, visitors can soak in two stone-lined hot pools with views over the sea, Drangey island, and the surrounding mountains. The larger pool maintains a temperature around 39-43°C (102-109°F) while a smaller, cooler pool provides a place to refresh. The pools are simple and natural, with minimal development to preserve their authentic character. A small changing hut provides basic facilities. The site is managed by the adjacent Reykir guesthouse and campsite, which collects a modest entrance fee during the summer season. This is one of Iceland's most historically significant bathing sites, offering visitors a chance to literally follow in the footsteps of legendary saga heroes while enjoying stunning coastal scenery.",
