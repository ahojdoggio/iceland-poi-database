  "description": "Reykjavík is the capital and largest city of Iceland, with a population of approximately 130,000 in the city proper and about 230,000 in the greater Reykjavík area, representing roughly two-thirds of Iceland's total population. It is the world's northernmost capital of a sovereign state, located at 64°08'N latitude. The city serves as Iceland's cultural, financial, and governmental center, housing the Alþingi (parliament), the presidential residence, and most major institutions. Reykjavík translates to \"Smoky Bay,\" named by early Viking settler Ingólfur Arnarson around 874 AD, who saw steam rising from geothermal vents and mistook it for smoke. The city is renowned for its vibrant arts scene, colorful buildings, innovative architecture like the iconic Hallgrímskirkja church, excellent restaurants, lively nightlife, and progressive culture. Despite its small size, Reykjavík offers world-class museums, galleries, concert halls like Harpa, geothermal swimming pools, and serves as the main hub for exploring Iceland's natural wonders.",
