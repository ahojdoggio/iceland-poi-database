  "name": "Arnarstapi",
  "description": "Arnarstapi is a small and charming fishing village on the southern coast of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula in West Iceland, with a population of fewer than 10 residents. The village sits beneath the towering Snæfellsjökull glacier and is named after Mt. Stapafell nearby. The beach holds a particular attraction: an eroded circular stone arch called Gatklettur, created by centuries of pounding Atlantic waves. Dramatic basalt columns, sea stacks, and rock formations line the coastline, making it a paradise for photographers and nature lovers. The area is also rich in birdlife, with numerous seabirds nesting on the cliffs during summer months. A scenic 2.5-kilometer coastal walking path connects Arnarstapi to the neighboring village of Hellnar, offering spectacular ocean views. The village features a striking stone sculpture of Bárður Snæfellsás, a half-troll guardian figure from Icelandic folklore, created by artist Ragnar Kjartansson.",
