  "name": "Varmaland Swimming Pool - Seasonal Highland Retreat",
  "description": "Varmaland Swimming Pool offers a seasonal highland bathing experience in a small geothermal village built around natural hot springs in the Stafholtstungur area of Borgarfjörður, West Iceland, operating exclusively during summer months (late June to mid-August) to serve both the small local community and travelers exploring Iceland's less-visited interior regions where authentic rural character and geothermal abundance create an atmospheric retreat from tourist-heavy coastal routes. Varmaland is a tiny settlement—barely qualifying as a village—that exists primarily because of the geothermal area's reliable hot water supply, which historically attracted farming families who utilized the natural heat for various domestic and agricultural purposes. The area sits in Iceland's interior highlands at moderate elevation where the landscape transitions from coastal lowlands to the barren volcanic deserts of the true highlands, creating scenery characterized by extensive lava fields, distant glacier views, and the raw volcanic geology that defines Iceland's interior. The swimming facility operates as a seasonal sports center open only during the brief Icelandic summer when daylight extends nearly 24 hours and visitors can reasonably access highland areas without winter's harsh conditions and impassable roads. The outdoor pool spans 25 x 12.5 meters, providing adequate space for lap swimming, recreational bathing, and the peaceful relaxation that comes from soaking in geothermally heated water surrounded by Iceland's raw highland beauty.",
