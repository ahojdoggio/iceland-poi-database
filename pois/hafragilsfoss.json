  "name": "Hafragilsfoss - Canyon Depths Waterfall",
  "description": "Hafragilsfoss is the third and final major waterfall in the spectacular trio along Iceland's powerful Jökulsá á Fjöllum river, located approximately 2.5 kilometers downstream from the famous Dettifoss in the depths of the magnificent Jökulsárgljúfur canyon in Vatnajökull National Park. While Dettifoss and its upstream neighbor Selfoss receive the majority of visitor attention, Hafragilsfoss offers perhaps the most dramatically vertical canyon setting of the three, plunging 27-30 meters (89-98 feet) across a width of approximately 90-91 meters (295-299 feet) into what is arguably the most spectacular section of the Jökulsárgljúfur gorge, where canyon walls tower 100-120 meters (330-390 feet) on both sides, creating an overwhelming sense of scale and geological power. The name \"Hafragilsfoss\" translates to \"Goat Canyon Falls\" or \"Ram's Canyon Falls,\" referencing the steep, nearly vertical canyon walls that only the most sure-footed animals could navigate. The waterfall drops in a single powerful curtain of milky-gray glacial water over dark volcanic rock ledges, sending up constant spray and mist that often creates rainbows when sunlight penetrates into the canyon's depths. What makes Hafragilsfoss particularly special is its position within the deepest, most impressive section of the canyon—standing at the viewpoints, visitors experience the full vertical drama of the gorge with the waterfall as centerpiece, framed by sheer basalt cliffs that dwarf human scale and convey the catastrophic power of the glacial floods that carved this landscape.",
